- allowing contract to support several escrow accounts
- using escrow account map instead of array, to save gas cost/optimize for efficiency
    - also allows to fetch accounts by a key, and can use a semantically meaningful key
    - dynamically sized array is less gas efficient (citations needed)
- using uni v2 as a reference for 'best practices'
    - using a factory pattern to create pairs
        - likely unnecessary for escrow, as they are short lived contracts, and increase cost of creating escrow accounts
